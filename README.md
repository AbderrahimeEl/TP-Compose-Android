# TP-Compose-Android

## Description
The goal of this project is to explore **Jetpack Compose**, the modern UI toolkit for Android development recommended by Google. The project focuses on building interactive UIs using Compose, following the principles of declarative programming.

## Features
- **Jetpack Compose Basics**: Learn how to create UIs using Compose functions.
- **State Management**: Understand how to manage and update UI state in a Compose application.
- **Custom Composable Functions**: Build reusable UI components.
- **Preview Functionality**: Use `@Preview` to visualize UI components in Android Studio.
- **Traffic Light Simulation**: Implement a traffic light system using Compose.
- **Crossroad Simulation**: Extend the traffic light system to simulate a crossroad with multiple lights.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into the following packages:
- **feu3**: Contains the traffic light simulation.
  - `state`: Defines the state of the traffic light.
  - `controller`: Manages the logic for updating the state.
  - `ui`: Contains the composable functions for rendering the UI.
- **carrefour**: Extends the traffic light simulation to a crossroad.
  - `state`: Defines the state of the crossroad.
  - `controller`: Manages the logic for updating the crossroad state.
  - `ui`: Contains the composable functions for rendering the crossroad UI.
